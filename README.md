# foosball

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thomaschrstnsn/foosball.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thomaschrstnsn/foosball)

Web application for tracking foosball match results and statistics.

But most of all, a playground for  learning web development with 
[Clojure](http://clojure.org), [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) and 
[Datomic](http://www.datomic.com).

Most of the concepts discovered/used/copied here have been crystalized into the 
[gyag](https://github.com/thomaschrstnsn/gyag-template) Leiningen template.

# Status

Running in [production](http://foosball.chrstnsn.dk) since april 2013. 
If you can use this as a basis for your own site, go ahead.  
This codebase has no intensions of becoming the *all singing, all dancing, generic foosball site*, 
pull requests will be considered in this light.

# Running a development environment

## Prerequisites  

1. You need an instance of Datomic running.
I can recommend the wrapper [cldwalker/datomic-free](https://github.com/cldwalker/datomic-free)

2. **(optional)** `phantom-js` (headless browser for running client-side tests against)

## Server-side

1. To run server-side, see the [gyag template README](https://github.com/thomaschrstnsn/gyag-template)

2. Continuous server-side test runner: `lein clj-autotest` (occupies a terminal tab)

## Client-side (browser)

The browser code has three profiles, `dev`, `production` and `testable`. 
`production` is `:advanced` compiled,  `dev` is not and has continuous reload support via figwheel.
`testable` is for running tests on `phantom-js`.

### `dev`-profile

1. Continuous running/live updating client-side: `lein cljs-figwheel` (occupies a terminal tab)
2. Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

### `production`-profile

1. Continuous rebuild of client-side with production profile: `lein cljs-production`
2. Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/production.html](http://localhost:8080/production.html)

### `testable`-profile

1. Continuous client-side tests in headless `phantom-js` (required local install): 
`lein cljs-autotest` (occupies a terminal tab)
